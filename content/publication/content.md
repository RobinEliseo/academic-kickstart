Abstract:
The climate crisis could become one of the new dividing points in our democracy. With Eurobarometer data, we show in this paper that the respondents from the north and west of Europe, the more educated citizens, the managers, the students and the youngest individuals, those with a positive view on the economy and a positive attitude toward the political institutions declare climate change more often as one of the main issues.
