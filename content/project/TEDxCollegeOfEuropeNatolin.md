A TEDx event is a local gathering where live TED-like talks and videos previously recorded at a TED conference are shared with the community. TEDx events are fully planned and coordinated independently, on a community-by-community basis. A TEDx event is a suite of short, carefully prepared talks, demonstrations, and performances that are idea-focused, and cover a wide range of subjects to foster learning, inspiration, and wonder – and provoke conversations that matter. Our goal is to spark conversation, connection, and community.


The third edition of TEDxCollegeOfEuropeNatolin hosted by Mr Mark DEKKER, an improvisational actor, and passionate entrepreneur, aimed at exploring the depth of Diversity, addressing the "elephant in the room" and inspiring society to make changes that destruct walls and construct bridges.

## Màriam Lutfi Royo  
### Dancer and Lawyer  
In 2013, Màriam met Leukaemia and her fast-moving world stopped abruptly; but luckily, keeping positive and dancing, she overcame this disease. This dancer tries to uncover our today’s reality in order to positively raise social awareness of Leukaemia in two directions: first, she defines people who suffer Leukaemia not as weak, but unstoppable, stronger and more alive than ever; and second, she demonstrates how solidarity is the perfect ingredient to make this disease 100% curable.
