#Màriam Lutfi Royo  
##Dancer and Lawyer  
In 2013, Màriam met Leukaemia and her fast-moving world stopped abruptly; but luckily, keeping positive and dancing, she overcame this disease. This dancer tries to uncover our today’s reality in order to positively raise social awareness of Leukaemia in two directions: first, she defines people who suffer Leukaemia not as weak, but unstoppable, stronger and more alive than ever; and second, she demonstrates how solidarity is the perfect ingredient to make this disease 100% curable.
